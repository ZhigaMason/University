## Maskym Khavil's BI-ZUM LS25 repository

**BI-ZUM** is an Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals course at [CTU FIT](https://fit.cvut.cz/en), it included three homeworks and one semestral project.

### Homework 01

The first homework is an implementation of path-finding algorithms, such as **BFS**, **DFS**, **Random Search**, **Greedy Search**, **A-star**, we also examine different metrics for the last two algorithms.

### Homework 02

The second homework task is to solve N-Queens problem using one of the black-box optimization techniques. I have settled down for population methods.

### Homework 03

The task is to solve **Multi-Agent Path-Finding**. For that I have designed a generator to produce problems and domains in PDDL and used Fast-Downward solver.

### Semestral Project

Inspired by [Paintings-from-Polygons: Simulated Annealing](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2827/KBS-Paper_2.pdf) by Dahmani *et al*, I have made a C++ app that redraws provided picuture using only rectangles. "Painting" is a simulated annealing, user can choose between different temperature schedulers. Computationally slow candidate mutation is multithreaded.
