# Semestral Project 1

Our representative is Oleksandr Slyvka, his M-value is 6, that corresponds to Spain, thus we will investigate its data.

## Libraries & Data

The following libraries are used in this R Markdown notebook.

```{R setup, include=FALSE}
library(eurostat)
library(dplyr)
library(vtable)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(e1071)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

Now we will download dataset, and filter it to contain only information about employment in Spain regions in year 2022.

```{R}
# Raw data
data <- get_eurostat("nama_10r_3empers")
# Selection 2022 only
data <- data[(as.Date('2022-01-01') <= data$TIME_PERIOD) & ( data$TIME_PERIOD < as.Date('2023-01-01')),]
# Number of employed per a thousand citizens
data <- data[(data$wstatus == 'EMP'),]
# NUTS 3 regions in Spain
data <- data[grepl('ES...', data$geo),]
```

We will combine **nace_r2** into four coarser categories *LARGE_BUSINESS*, *SMALL_BUSINESS*, *FINANCE* and *PUBLIC*. Dataset additionally prodvides accumulated *TOTAL* by region, so we will transform it into its own category.

```{R}
data$nace_cat <- "UNKOWN_CATEGORY"
data[grepl("A|B|C|D|E|F", data$nace_r2),]$nace_cat   <- "LARGE_BUSINESS"
data[grepl("G|H|I|J", data$nace_r2),]$nace_cat       <- "SMALL_BUSINESS"
data[grepl("K|L|M|N", data$nace_r2),]$nace_cat       <- "FINANCE"
data[grepl("O|P|Q|R|S|T|U", data$nace_r2),]$nace_cat <- "PUBLIC"
data[grepl("TOTAL", data$nace_r2),]$nace_cat         <- "TOTAL"
head(data)
```

We will aggregate all samples based on their **geo** and **nace_cat** feature, because they were split on **nace_r2** subtypes in raw datset.

```{R}
data <- aggregate(values ~ geo + nace_cat, data, sum)
head(data)
```

Our data contains region *ESZZZ* , which is extra region in NUTS 3 and thus contain little statistical significance, but cause some computational problems, so we will remove it here.

```{r}
data <- data[data$geo != 'ESZZZ',]
```

Lastly we will convert **geo** and **nace_cat** into factors and rename **values** to **thousands_employed**.

```{R}
data$geo      <- as.factor(data$geo)
data$nace_cat <- as.factor(data$nace_cat)
colnames(data)[3] <- 'thousands_employed'
head(data)
```

Let's separate unaccumulated NACE categories from *TOTAL*.

```{R}
data.geo.sep <- droplevels(data[data$nace_cat != "TOTAL",])
head(data.geo.sep)
```

```{R}
data.geo.acc <- droplevels(data[data$nace_cat == "TOTAL",])
head(data.geo.acc)
```

## Data Description & Graphs

Let's display the mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, and skewness with regard to the *TOTAL*.

```{R warning=FALSE}
summ <- c('mean(x)', 'sd(x)', 'skewness(x)', 'min(x)', 'pctile(x)[25]', 
          'median(x)', 'pctile(x)[75]', 'max(x)', 'IQR(x)'
)

sumtable(
  data.geo.acc, 'thousands_employed',
  out='kable',
  summ=summ
)
```

We can see that data is strongly skewed to the right, that is, there are many samples with smaller than average employed population, also standard deviation and IQR are quite large (593 and 294 thousands people). It is reasonable, as Spain has both city-dense areas as Catalonia and rural regions like Iberian mountains.

We will now dig into NACE category differences.

```{R warning=FALSE}
sumtable(
  data.geo.sep, 'thousands_employed',
  out='kable',
  summ=summ,
  group='nace_cat',  group.long=TRUE
)
```

Visually *SMALL_BUSSINESS*, *LARGE_BUSINESS* and *PUBLIC* categories employ many more people than *FINANCE*. Additionally all categories show very similar skewness, so it could be expected that they match.

Let's Make Q-Q plots to see if those variables are normal.

```{R}
pfin <- ggplot(
        data.geo.sep[data.geo.sep$nace_cat == 'FINANCE',],
        aes(sample=thousands_employed)
    )   +
        stat_qq(distribution=qnorm, show.legend=T) +
        stat_qq_line(distribution=qnorm, show.legend=F) +
        ggtitle("FINANCE")

psmall <- ggplot(
        data.geo.sep[data.geo.sep$nace_cat == 'SMALL_BUSINESS',],
        aes(sample=thousands_employed)
    )   +
        stat_qq(distribution=qnorm, show.legend=T) +
        stat_qq_line(distribution=qnorm, show.legend=F) +
        ggtitle("SMALL_BUSINESS")


ppub <- ggplot(
        data.geo.sep[data.geo.sep$nace_cat == 'PUBLIC',],
        aes(sample=thousands_employed)
    )   +
        stat_qq(distribution=qnorm, show.legend=T) +
        stat_qq_line(distribution=qnorm, show.legend=F) +
        ggtitle("PUBLIC")


plarge <- ggplot(
        data.geo.sep[data.geo.sep$nace_cat == 'LARGE_BUSINESS',],
        aes(sample=thousands_employed)
    )   +
        stat_qq(distribution=qnorm, show.legend=T) +
        stat_qq_line(distribution=qnorm, show.legend=F) +
        ggtitle("LARGE_BUSINESS")

plot_grid(pfin, psmall, ppub, plarge)
```

All Q-Q plots diverge from normal quantile line at the edges and explodes in positive side. We could say that those distributions are not normal, later normality can be tested by numerical methods.

## Contingency table

We will create contingency table over all NUTS 3 regions and all NACE categories.

```{R}
ct <- addmargins(xtabs(formula=thousands_employed ~ geo + nace_cat, data.geo.sep))
print(head(ct, 5))
cat("...\n")
print(tail(ct, 3))
```

Let's test if regions have the same distribution of employment. Pearson's Chi Squared Homogeneity Test will assist us in that (the condition of having 5 or more expected counts in 80% of cells in large table is met).

$$
H_0: \text{Employment does not depend on a region}\\
H_A: \text{Employment does depend on a region}
$$

```{R warning=FALSE}
ct_test <- xtabs(formula=thousands_employed ~ geo + nace_cat, data.geo.sep)
print(head(ct_test, 3))
chisq.test(ct_test)
```

p-value is much less than $\alpha = 0.05$, so we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. Conclusion is that the proportions of people employed in distinct categories are **not the same** for different regions.

## Tests

Let's extend our data a bit before making further hypotheses by using a dataset about the population in NUTS 3 regions.

```{r}
# population density by NUTS 3 regions
pop_dens_nuts3 <- get_eurostat("demo_r_d3dens")
pop_dens_nuts3 <- pop_dens_nuts3[(as.Date('2022-01-01') <= pop_dens_nuts3$TIME_PERIOD) & ( pop_dens_nuts3$TIME_PERIOD < as.Date('2023-01-01')),]
pop_dens_nuts3 <- pop_dens_nuts3[grepl('ES...', pop_dens_nuts3$geo),]

# area by NUTS 3 regions
area_nuts3 <- get_eurostat("reg_area3")
area_nuts3 <- area_nuts3[(as.Date('2022-01-01') <= area_nuts3$TIME_PERIOD) & ( area_nuts3$TIME_PERIOD < as.Date('2023-01-01')),]
area_nuts3 <- area_nuts3[grepl('ES...', area_nuts3$geo),]
area_nuts3 <- area_nuts3[area_nuts3$landuse == 'TOTAL',]

area <- area_nuts3[, c("geo", "values")]
pop_dens <- pop_dens_nuts3[, c("geo", "values")]

# combining two together
merged_data <- merge(pop_dens, area, by = "geo", suffixes = c("_pop_dens", "_area"))
merged_data$product <- merged_data$values_pop_dens * merged_data$values_area
population <- merged_data[, c("geo", "product")]
colnames(population)[colnames(population) == "product"] <- "pop_in_thousands"
population$pop_in_thousands <- population$pop_in_thousands / 1000

# population by regions in thousands
head(population)
```

### Existence of correlation between employment and population

Let's check hypothesis:

$$
H_0: \text{Correlation between employment and population is 0 }\\
H_A: \text{Correlation is not 0}
$$

First we can combine total employment and population in one table to predict how the test can end.

```{r}
data.corr.test = merge(data.geo.acc, population, by='geo')
head(data.corr.test, 3)
```

It seems like 40% of the population in each region is employed. We can find pearson correlation coefficient to check the linear relation.

```{r}
cor.test(data.corr.test$thousands_employed, data.corr.test$pop_in_thousands, method='pearson', alternative = "two.sided")
```

p-value is low, so we reject the null hypothesis. Result of the test indicates almost perfect positive linear relationship and we can predict population from employment and vise versa.

### **Testing if SMALL_BUSINESS** and **PUBLIC** come hand-in-hand in all regions

Looking at the data we can suppose that in each region employment in **SMALL_BUSINESS** is equal to the employment in **PUBLIC** in the region. This lead to the hypotheses:

$$
H_0: \text{Employment levels in SMALL_BUSINESS and PUBLIC are similar}\\
H_A: \text{One category tends to have higher employment than the other}
$$

This can be tested with a paired test. But the choice of the test depends on the distribution of differences of the values. If it is normal, we can use stronger paired t-test, if it is at least symmetric, we would use non-parametric test: Wilcox signed-rank test. And if we cannot use neither of them, we would go for signed test.

```{r}
# Transforming data with NACE categories to wide format for convenient use
data.sep.wide <- 
  pivot_wider(data.geo.sep, names_from = nace_cat, values_from = thousands_employed)
head(data.sep.wide, 2)
```

Let's test the normality with Shapiro-Wilk normality test:

```{r}
shapiro.test(data.sep.wide$PUBLIC - data.sep.wide$SMALL_BUSINESS)
```

Test indicates, that the differences are unlikely to be normal.

Next is symmetry:

```{r}
hist(data.sep.wide$PUBLIC - data.sep.wide$SMALL_BUSINESS, main = "Histogram of Differences", xlab = "Differences", breaks = 20)
```

```{r}
cat("Differences distribution skewness:", skewness(data.sep.wide$PUBLIC - data.sep.wide$SMALL_BUSINESS))
```

As we see the differences has non-zero skewness and thus our only option is Sign test. From the histogram we can notice that differences are mostly positive, and thus we will assume that employment in **PUBLIC** can be greater. Let's denote (**PUBLIC**, **SMALL_BUSINESS**) pairs as $(X_i, Y_i)$. Our hypotheses fitted on Sign test are:

$$
H_0: \text{The median of the $X_i - Y_i$ is 0}\\
H_A: \text{The median of the differences is greater than 0}
$$

```{r}
differences <- data.sep.wide$PUBLIC - data.sep.wide$SMALL_BUSINESS
public_higher <- sum(differences > 0)
regions_cnt <- length(differences)

# Perform the Sign Test using binomial test
binom.test(public_higher, regions_cnt, p = 0.5, alternative = "greater")
```

p-value now is not as low as in the previous tests, but still we reject null hypothesis under significance level of 5%. This means that we can expect employment in **PUBLIC** to be greater in regions.

### **SMALL_BUSINESS** and LARGE_BUSINESS distribution comparison

It's important to test the distributions of employment to know, for example, if workers have equal access to job opportunities across both small and large businesses. Let's plot histograms of those variables.

```{R}
cat1 <- "SMALL_BUSINESS"
cat2 <- "LARGE_BUSINESS"

data.ct.test = droplevels(data.geo.sep[data.geo.sep$nace_cat %in% c(cat1, cat2),])

breaks <- seq(
    min(data.ct.test$thousands_employed), 
    max(data.ct.test$thousands_employed), 
    length.out = 40
)

hist(
    data.ct.test[data.ct.test$nace_cat == cat1,]$thousands_employed,
    freq=FALSE, col=rgb(0.6,0,0, 0.6),
    main = "Histograms", xlab = "Thousands employed", ylab = "Density",
    breaks=breaks
)

hist(
    data.ct.test[data.ct.test$nace_cat == cat2,]$thousands_employed,
    freq=FALSE, col=rgb(0,0,0.6, 0.6), add=TRUE,
    breaks=breaks
)

legend("topright", legend = c(cat1, cat2),
       fill = c(rgb(0.6,0,0, 0.6), rgb(0,0,0.6, 0.6))
       )
```

Distributions look similar. Let's formulate our hypothesis. For region let $F$ be the distribution of employed people in **SMALL_BUSINESS** and $G$ be a distribution of people employed in **LARGE_BUSINESS**, then our hypotheses are:

$$
H_0: F = G\\
H_A: F \neq G
$$

We will use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which is more suitable for comparison of the distribution shapes. Mann-Whitney U test would be more focused on comparing central tendencies.

```{r}
ks.test(data.sep.wide$SMALL_BUSINESS, data.sep.wide$LARGE_BUSINESS)
```

p-value is greater than $α=0.05$, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis and cannot conclude that the distributions are different.

## Conclusion

Our research provided valuable insights into the population of Spain, contributing to a broader understanding of employment trends in European countries. Even though our findings lack practical significance, the project was highly beneficial for study purposes, as it not only deepened our understanding of statistics but also enhanced our proficiency in the R language.
