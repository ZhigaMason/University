    "# Homework 02: Non-systematic state space traversal - 2+A - Genetic Algorithm for N queens problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try  to place $N$ queens on $N$ by $N$ chessboard, such that no queen attacks other, that is none of them share vertical, horizontal or diagonal line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "To implement Genetic Algorithm we need to define:\n",
    "* Problem encoding - how to represent queens' positions\n",
    "* Loss/Fitness function - measure that we will try to optimize\n",
    "* Selection - to propagate best individuals further into generations\n",
    "* Crossover - to mimic evolutions genom crossing\n",
    "* Mutation  - to increase diversity and escape local minima\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above except *Selection* will be encapsulated in **Individual** class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our chromosome will consist of $N$ numbers in range $[0, N-1] \\cap \\mathbb{Z}$ that will represent a queen at position $(i, c_i)$, where $i$ is row on which the queen is located and $c_i$ is $i$-th entry in chromosome. This encoding does not allow for queens to share rows, nevertheless it is enough to represent correct solution due to our restraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use number of attacking pairs as loss function. If it is zero, then no queen attacks the other and we have solved it. Therefore our goal is to minimize number of attacking pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For crossover we will choose one-point strategy where we will swap prefixes of random length of two chromosomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutations will be parametrized by number of trials and probability of mutation. On each trial with ceratin probability random entry of chromosome will be changed to other number in gene-range."

    "We were able to reach some level of success with genetic algorithm for N-Queens resolving up to $N=50$. Though, some improvements can be made. Algorithm can be modified, we can choose different crossover and mutation tactics or try to use chane-selection to bring more diversity. Computational difficulty is another obstacle, so implementing Genetic Algorithm in faster language like Rust or Cython, would definetly allow for greater number generations and thus better results."
