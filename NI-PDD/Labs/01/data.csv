0;US;This big, bold, full-bodied wine has everything in spades: giant aromas of boysenberry, saturated jammy flavors, thick but fine-textured tannins, plenty of alcohol and an appealing viscosity that carries the flavors through a long finish.

1;US;Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon are equally represented in this soft, robust blend that also includes smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

2;Italy;The region of Lazio is making promising inroads into quality wine production.

3;US;A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak. Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6–8 years.;Confluence Vineyard;97;75.0;California;Anderson Valley;;;;;;Goldeneye 2007 Confluence Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley);Pinot Noir;Goldeneye

5;US;Very tasty and large in scale, it sports a huge nose of dark plum and heavy cedar, along with cinnamon and vanilla accents wrapped in very toasty oak. Very dark fruit with licorice shadings and an elegant, supple mouthfeel add to the appeal.

6;US;This bottling screams white earth, with a chalk- and riverstone-like minerality and clotted cream and lemon scents. That minerality carries through to the palate, where a chalky note blends with Asian pear and marshmallow. It's a study in how to present delicate flavors with pizzazz, which the Talley family has been known to do.;Oliver's Vineyard;94;38.0;California;Edna Valley;Central Coast;Matt Kettmann;@mattkettmann;male;;Talley 2014 Oliver's Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley);Chardonnay;Talley
7;US;Produced from a mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a chewy, substantial wine, with dark fruit flavors of plum and black cherry. Light suggestions of coffee, gravel and iron also factor in.

8;US;This shows the finesse of the vineyard, not to mention the winemaker's talent. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, it's bone dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins that make it one for the cellar. It has a huge core of blackberry and black currant fruit that's waiting to emerge.

9;Chile;Quite the floral wine, with blueberry and violet aromas that distinguish it from others. But the palate is sharp and choppy, with high acidity that lends sharpness to the black cherry and raspberry flavors. Stirs interest because it breaks the mold of heavy, black fruit-dominated Syrahs. But it's also strange and not fully in gear.

10;US;Bright lemon, lime and sweet grass aromas trend toward passionfruit on this fresh, fruity wine from Southern California.

11;US;I like this wine a lot, even though it doesn't have Viognier's typical exotic richness. Bone dry, with mouth-tingling acidity and low alcohol, it shows citrus, coconut macaroon, apricot and spice flavors that finish with real complexity.

12;US;Light in aromas, this reasonably priced wine by the Talley family eventually shows subtle earth and game on the nose.

13;US;There is some volatility in the nose, along with strong scents of the new French oak. But the flavors are substantial and bring tart fruit with black olive, toast and coffee highlights.

16;US;This has a vivid, gold color with just a touch of pink, which makes sense considering Pinot Gris is not really a white wine grape, but a gris or gray shade in between blanc and noir. Aromas are like buttered popcorn, toasted almond and a touch of honey. It is undeniably flavorful, lush in texture and full bodied.

19;US;Although this is the least costly of the winery's Pinots, it's a lovely wine. Blending from a vast source of vineyards has given winemaker Cabral the ability to fill in divots of every kind.

20;France;Harvested in November 2011 from botrytized grapes which have benefited from the autumn mists, the wine is a fine combination of intense acidity and superrich honeyed flavors.

24;US;Another successful Marinus from this small Monterey County appellation.

43;US;The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend.

1646;Spain;This 50-50 blend of Monastrell and Cabernet Sauvignon is jammy and modest on the bouquet. In the mouth, it's plump but a bit wishy-washy, with generic dark-berry flavors.

1820;France;A rich nose of honey, marmalade and yeast opens to full apple and lemon-custard flavors.

The counterpart to the Love Boat Red is this kitchen sink white blend of  28% Sauvignon Blanc, 21% Grenache Blanc, 21% Roussanne, 15% Semillon, 9% Chenin Blanc and 6% Viognier. There's a ton going on, with new layers of aroma and flavor with each sniff and sip. Ripe scents of pineapple, melon, honeycomb, honeysuckle and spiced apple dance in the bouquet and transition through to the medium-weight palate. Medium acidity keeps the ripeness in check, lending verve to the lemon curd and baked apple fueled finish.

1986;US;This is a great example of a dry well-balanced Zin to drink with dinner rather than as a sweet dessert. It's also a taste of history, coming from a vineyard originally planted in 1869.

1987;US;This intriguing bottling shows the cool vintage's influence.

2530;US;A real success, this 100% Merlot, sourced from the Stillwater Creek and Conner Lee vineyards, is exotically scented with a rich mix of baking spices, coffee, dust, pencil lead and cedar.

7125;US;This noted Napa producer has excelled at Petite Sirah for a long time, and with the impressive 2010, they've out-done themselves. The wine comes from a vineyard block, said to be more than 70 years of age, that contains other varieties, such as Carignane, Grenache and Syrah. Thus, it's a field blend of the type that Italian-American vintners produced throughout much of the 20th century. Dry and tannic, with wild berry, currant, licorice, tobacco and oak flavors, the wine is wonderful now, and should develop bottle complexities until 2034.;Ne Cede Malis Estate Grown;93;80.0;California;Stags Leap District;Napa;;;;;Stags' Leap Winery 2010 Ne Cede Malis Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Stags Leap District);Petite Sirah;Stags' Leap Winery

7940;France;Firm and hard, this shows density rather than fruit, tannin rather than freshness. It goes for the dark side of Clos Vougeot.

7955;US;Fresh and leesy, this stainless steel-fermented Pinot Gris spent six months on the lees, giving it extra freshness and texture. Sweet grass and fresh herbs spread nicely across the palate, and the 15% alcohol does not register as such.

The palate has the same clear lemon purity but has a rich fluid texture of ripeness and concentration—a wonderful interplay of fruit richness and taut freshness that creates tension and poise. While the palate is completely dry, the lemon depth attains the richness of lemon oil and candied zest. The tanginess lingers long on the pure finish. This is lovely and pure now, but bottle age will make it beguiling.

8413;Austria;Spicy oak flavors dominate the nose and marry beautifully with the red berry, cherry and forest floor notes. This is Pinot made in an international style that nonetheless keeps its Austrian backbone of fresh acidity and lovely, tingling pepper spice. The fact that this is from 2010 and has just began to show its colors signals its seriousness. It is ready now but will also reward further cellaring.

8889;US;A layered, somewhat delicate nose of rose petals, purple flowers, cola spice and raspberry-laced chocolate serves as the introduction to this bottling.

8890;US;You have to love the '07 vintage. This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off. Rich and delicious, full-bodied and aromatic, with exotic barrel scents and a lovely mélange of chocolate, mocha, caramel and spice.

8898;US;The winemaker calls this a “more masculine wine: richer, bigger,” which almost understates the case. It's fruity to the point of bomb, offering an orchard of ripe red cherries, raspberries, red plums, cola and something tropically sweet, like red mango. It's all liberally enhanced with the sweet vanillins of oak.

9160;Brazil;This Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend almost has enough of the right stuff to rate higher, but in the end the wine's tart cherry fruit and sharp acidity is just too unfriendly.

9979;Argentina;Compact and concentrated up front, the nose is propped up with hints of spice and berry. This shows good body and balance, with berry and licorice flavors that are lightly baked, mildly herbal and peppery. Despite a touch of green on the finish, this is very good.;Altos del Plata;87;12.0;Mendoza Province;Mendoza;;Michael Schachner;@wineschach;male;;Terrazas de Los Andes 2010 Altos del Plata Malbec (Mendoza);Malbec;Terrazas de Los Andes
9980;France;With vines in the Grand Cru village of Bouzy, this producer has a fine palette at its disposal. The rosé—crisp with Chardonnay yet bolstered with rich Pinot Noir—is full bodied and packed with raspberry and red currant fruit. Still young, it's lively with acidity and exuberant fruitiness.

9981;France;"Quite delicate herb, lime, mineral and smoke aromas on the nose open to a full yet still lean mouth of bright citrus and herb flavors. The P-J style tends to lightness, and this is a fine rendering, with great balance and nice body. Lovely and crisp, like a crunchy Granny Smith apple.

9982;France;Jaboulet's view of its most famous wine seems to have changed. Although the concentrated, dense tannins and big black fruit flavors are still there, it has lost the huge brooding presence of past vintages, and now has a veneer of sophistication with superripe fruit, plums and dark jam tastes. Whether this 1999 will age as well as older vintages remains to be seen, but it will certainly be ready to drink sooner.;La Chapelle;94;131.0;Rhône Valley;Hermitage;;Roger Voss;@vossroger;male;;Paul Jaboulet Aîné 1999 La Chapelle  (Hermitage);Rhône-style Red Blend;Paul Jaboulet Aîné

9984;US;With its off-dry tango of sweet, tart and mineral components, this is a standout among a large range of Rieslings from Chehalem. Apple and white peach, citrus oil and wet stone are in play, with some grippy tannins adding a taste of orange pekoe tea. The residual sugar, listed at 16 g/L, is off-set with balancing acidity.;Three Vineyard;90;29.0;Oregon;Willamette Valley;Willamette Valley;Paul Gregutt;@paulgwine ;male;;Chehalem 2015 Three Vineyard Riesling (Willamette Valley);Riesling;Chehalem
9985;Chile;After hard-edged, herbal aromas mellow, spicy, earthy notes of blackberry rise up. This feels full and big-boned, with baked, toasty black-cherry flavors that are so fully oaked that the finish turns bitter, with a bit of mocha.;Los Vascos Grande Reserve;89;20.0;Colchagua Valley;;;Michael Schachner;@wineschach;male;;Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2013 Los Vascos Grande Reserve Carmenère (Colchagua Valley);Carmenère;Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)

9987;US;Concentrated aromas of pomegranate, cranberry and mulberry meet with broodingly spiced notes of cola, pencil shavings, dried mint and mossy earth on the nose of this bottling.

9988;South Africa;This vintage of Fusion V is already approachable and enjoyable, with ripe aromas and flavors of brambly berry and cherry that are accented by attractive notes of cocoa powder, cigar tobacco, sweet spice and leather. The fine tannins are grippy and structured, complementing the black pepper, toast and licorice elements that linger on the finish.

9990;France;A hint of smoke and a touch of earth precede the fresh lemon notes of the nose. The dry palate, with its vivid impression of very pure, bright and incisive lemon freshness, still seems tightly wound. There is something brooding and alive about this—it can be felt below the surface, disquieting but promising. This has barely started on its journey and will take a while to develop fully but it's all already there, dormant and ready to unfurl with a little more bottle age.

This is in its very infancy and promises to open up beautifully with its straight, soaring backbone of freshness.

9993;France;This wine's aromas are strongly citrusy, with a squeeze of lime zest that gives it a lively sensation, but the flavors are more sedate and ripe, veering gently into apricots and melons.

9995;Spain;"Melis is a project backed by wine industry folks from California, but this blend of old-vines Grenache along with Carignan, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is very European. It's heady but well balanced, with smooth edges and not too much fiery attitude, roughness or scratchy tannins. It's forward and big-boned, but there's enough creamy richness to make it friendly. Needs plenty of air time now; should hold well for five-plus years.";Melis;92;99.0;Catalonia;Priorat;;Michael Schachner;@wineschach;male;;Cellers Melis 2005 Melis Red (Priorat);Red Blend;Cellers Melis

9997;Austria;A grassy hint of freshness accents this wine's ripe green and red apple-inflected nose.
